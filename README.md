# Lowcalibre Guild Recruitment Portal

This project is a prototype recruitment dashboard for the Lowcalibre guild. It is built with **React** and **TypeScript** using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js 18+):

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` &ndash; start the Vite development server
- `npm run build` &ndash; create a production build in the `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` &ndash; preview the production build locally
- `npm test` &ndash; run unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- `npm run lint` &ndash; lint the codebase using ESLint

## Notes

The project currently uses mocked data and authentication for demonstration purposes. In a real deployment these would be replaced with proper API calls and secure authentication.
